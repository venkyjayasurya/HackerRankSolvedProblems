/* Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task in this test is to find out which one of the given n numbers differs from the others.
Bob observed that one number usually differs from the others in evenness. Help Bob — to check his answers, he needs a program that among the given n
numbers finds one that is different in evenness.
Input Format
The first line contains integer n — amount of numbers in the task. The second line contains n space-separated natural numbers,
not exceeding 100. It is guaranteed, that exactly one of these numbers differs from the others in evenness.

Constraints:
(3≤n≤100)

Output Format:
Output index of number that differs from the others in evenness. Numbers are numbered from 1 in the input order.

Sample Input 0:
5
2 4 7 8 10

Sample Output 0:
3

Sample Input 1:
4
1 2 1 1

Sample Output 1:
2
