/*
You are the gym teacher in the school. There are n students in the row. And there are
two rivalling students among them. The first one is in position a, the second in position b.
Positions are numbered from 1 to n from left to right. Since they are rivals, you want to
maximize the distance between them. If students are in positions p and s respectively, then
distance between them is |p−s|.
You can do the following operation at most x times: choose two adjacent (neighbouring) students
and swap them. Calculate the maximum distance between two rivalling students after at most x swaps.
Input Format:
The first line contains one integer t — the number of test cases.
The only line of each test case contains four integers n, x, a and b — the number of students
in the row, the number of swaps which you can do, and positions of first and second rivaling
students respectively.
Constraints:
(1≤t≤100) (2≤n≤100, 0≤x≤100, 1≤a,b≤n, a≠b)
Output Format:
For each test case print one integer — the maximum distance between two rivaling
students which you can obtain.
In the first test case you can swap students in positions 3 and 4. And then the
distance between the rivals is equal to |4−2|=2.
